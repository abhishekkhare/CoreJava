/**
 * When you are done using the ExecutorService you should shut it down, so the
 * threads do not keep running.
 * 
 * For instance, if your application is started via a main() method and your
 * main thread exits your application, the application will keep running if you
 * have an active ExexutorService in your application. The active threads inside
 * this ExecutorService prevents the JVM from shutting down.
 * 
 * To terminate the threads inside the ExecutorService you call its shutdown()
 * method. The ExecutorService will not shut down immediately, but it will no
 * longer accept new tasks, and once all threads have finished current tasks,
 * the ExecutorService shuts down. All tasks submitted to the ExecutorService
 * before shutdown() is called, are executed.
 * 
 * If you want to shut down the ExecutorService immediately, you can call the
 * shutdownNow() method. This will attempt to stop all executing tasks right
 * away, and skips all submitted but non-processed tasks. There are no
 * guarantees given about the executing tasks. Perhaps they stop, perhaps the
 * execute until the end. It is a best effort attempt.
